Annual Raise App
----------------

This project contains a Google Apps Script (`Code.gs`) and an accompanying HTML
interface (`index.html`) for calculating annual raises for employees across
multiple departments.

The employee lists now include sticky column headers showing rank, employee
pay info, pay increase slider, percent increase, and hourly increase.

Header labels have been shortened and centered so they stay on one line.

See `AGENTS.md` for repository contribution guidelines.
